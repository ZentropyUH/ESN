# Keras Reservoir Computing

Empower Keras with state-of-the-art Reservoir Computing. Build, train and deploy Echo State Networks (ESNs) that slot seamlessly into larger ML pipelines.

```{admonition} Why KRC?
:class: tip
- Built on TensorFlow/Keras – easy integration with existing workflows
- First-class ESN components – reservoirs, readouts, initializers
- Fast readout training – custom trainer that respects model topology
- Robust forecasting utilities – warm-up + auto-regressive helpers
- Batteries included – HPO, data helpers
```

## Get started

We recommend reading the quickstart below. You can also follow the Tutorials for step-by-step guides.
